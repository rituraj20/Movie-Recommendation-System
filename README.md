# Movie-Recommendation-System
This movie recommendation system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on the cosine similarity between movies. The project involves several key steps, including data preprocessing and calculating the cosine similarity.

During the data preprocessing phase, the dataset of movies is cleaned and transformed to ensure accurate and consistent information. This may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data into a suitable format for analysis.

Once the data is preprocessed, the cosine similarity between movies is calculated. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors, and in this case, it is used to determine the similarity between the movie features or attributes. By comparing the movie attributes, such as genre, cast, director, or plot, the system can identify movies that share similar characteristics.

The calculated cosine similarity values are then used to generate movie recommendations. When a user selects a movie, the system identifies the most similar movies based on their cosine similarity scores. The top recommendations are displayed to the user, along with their corresponding movie posters, to enhance the visual appeal and provide a more immersive experience.

This project aims to help users discover new movies that align with their preferences and interests. By leveraging the power of cosine similarity and a user-friendly interface, the movie recommendation system offers an intuitive way for users to explore a vast collection of movies and find hidden gems that match their taste
